### Nice to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=TheChinCheaChilla.TheChinCheaChilla&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Seekout. In my free time I do silly things like powerlift, sleep, and watch Instagram reels that my girlfriend (who wrote this README) sends me.
